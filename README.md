## About the Dataset
The **Earthquakes Dataset (1990-2023)** is a comprehensive collection of data containing detailed information on earthquake events globally. It includes:

- **Date and Time**: Details of when the earthquake occurred.
- **Location**: Geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the earthquake's epicenter.
- **Magnitude and Depth**: Measurements related to the severity and depth of the earthquake.
- **Region**: Affected region or state.
- **Tsunami Indicator**: Indicates whether a tsunami was triggered by the earthquake.

### Importance and Utility
This dataset is highly valuable for:

1. **Earthquake Analysis and Prediction**: By analyzing historical earthquake data, scientists can identify patterns and predict future seismic events more accurately.
2. **Safety and Prevention**: Insights gained from the dataset can help in designing earthquake-resistant structures, enhancing public safety, and implementing effective preventive measures.
3. **Seismological Research**: It provides a rich resource for seismologists studying tectonic movements and geological faults, offering deeper insights into Earth's crust dynamics.
4. **Public Awareness**: Accessible earthquake data can inform individuals about seismic activity in their area, promoting awareness and preparedness.

## Project Analysis
Using **Power BI**, this project analyzes various aspects of the dataset, including:

- **Magnitude Analysis**: Identifying trends in earthquake magnitudes over time.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Visualizing the locations of earthquakes globally on an interactive map.
- **Depth Analysis**: Studying the relationship between earthquake depth and magnitude.
- **Tsunami Impact**: Evaluating the occurrences of tsunamis triggered by earthquakes.
